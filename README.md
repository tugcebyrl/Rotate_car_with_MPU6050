# Rotate_car_with_MPU6050
This is a simple Unity project for a car control script that allows the player to control the movement of a car in the forward direction and tilt it using the MPU6050 6 Axis Acceleration and Gyroscope Sensor. Both the accelerometer and gyro outputs provide IÂ²C output through separate channels. It can output with 16 bit resolution on each axis. Sensor data was obtained using the Arduino Mega board. The script uses Unity's Rigidbody component to simulate the realistic physics of the car. Both Arduino and Unity codes have been added to the project.

It was made in collaboration with Eda Derya Toper.
